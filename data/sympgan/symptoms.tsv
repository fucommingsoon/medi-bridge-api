They may occur 30 times or more an hour.</p> <p>The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/snoring.html'>snores</a> has sleep apnea.</p> <p>You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.</p> <p>Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.</p> <p>When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment.

Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.</p> <p>Most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. </p> <p>If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days, you should call your health care provider. You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/backinjuries.html'>injury</a>.</p> <p>Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it.

The result is hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature. It can make you sleepy, confused and clumsy. Because it happens gradually and affects your thinking, you may not realize you need help. That makes it especially dangerous. A body temperature below 95掳 F is a medical emergency and can lead to death if not treated promptly. </p> <p>Anyone who spends much time outdoors in cold weather can get hypothermia. You can also get it from being cold and wet, or under cold water for too long. Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping in a cold room. </p> <p >Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p>|	ICD10CM_2017:T68|ICD9CM_2014:991.6|SNOMEDCT_US_2016_09_01:241970005|SO:SYMP_0000302

Once the patient is in a horizontal position, blood flow to the brain is no longer hindered by gravitation and consciousness is regained. Unconsciousness usually lasts for seconds to minutes. Headache and drowsiness (which usually follow seizures) do not follow a syncopal attack. Syncope results from a sudden impairment of brain metabolism usually due to a reduction in cerebral blood flow. [HPO:probinson]|MEDLINEPLUS_20151021:<p>Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. If you're about to faint, you'll feel dizzy, lightheaded, or nauseous. Your field of vision may "white out" or "black out." Your skin may be cold and clammy. You lose muscle control at the same time, and may fall down.</p> <p>Fainting usually happens when your blood pressure <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/lowbloodpressure.html'>drops</a> suddenly, causing a decrease in blood flow to your brain. It is more common in older people. Some causes of fainting include</p> <ul> <li>Heat or dehydration </li> <li>Emotional distress </li> <li>Standing up too quickly </li> <li>Certain medicines </li> <li>Drop in blood sugar </li> <li>Heart problems </li> </ul> <p>When someone faints, make sure that the airway is clear and check for breathing. The person should stay lying down for 10-15 minutes. Most people recover completely. Fainting is usually nothing to worry about, but it can sometimes be a sign of a serious problem.

It's a feeling of discomfort or a burning feeling in your upper abdomen. You may have <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartburn.html'>heartburn</a> or belch and feel bloated. You may also feel nauseated, or even throw up.</p> <p>You might get indigestion from eating too much or too fast, eating high-fat foods, or eating when you're stressed. Smoking, drinking too much alcohol, using some medicines, being tired, and having ongoing stress can also cause indigestion or make it worse. Sometimes the cause is a problem with the digestive tract, like an <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pepticulcer.html'>ulcer</a> or <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/gerd.html'>GERD</a>.</p> <p>Avoiding foods and situations that seem to cause it may help. Because indigestion can be a sign of a more serious problem, see your health care provider if it lasts for more than two weeks or if you have severe pain or other symptoms. Your health care provider may use x-rays, lab tests, and an upper endoscopy to diagnose the cause. You may need medicines to treat the symptoms.</p> <p >NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>|MSH2017_2016_08_12:Impaired digestion, especially after eating.|NCI2016_02D:An uncomfortable, often painful feeling in the stomach, resulting from impaired digestion.

It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. When the heart beats faster than normal, it is called tachycardia. When the heart beats too slowly, it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/atrialfibrillation.html'>atrial fibrillation</a>, which causes an irregular and fast heart beat.</p> <p>Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartattack.html'>heart attack</a>, smoking, <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/congenitalheartdefects.html'>congenital heart defects</a>, and stress.

The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called <a href='https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/peritonealdisorders.html'>peritonitis</a>.</p> <p>The main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side.

Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity. WHY: Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis. HOW: A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, |CHV2011_02:the most dramatic type of seizure|CSP2006:the most dramatic type of seizure, characterized by tonic and clonic contraction of most skeletal muscles.|HPO2016_07_04:Seizures are an intermittent abnormality of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of cerebral neurons and characterized clinically by some combination of disturbance of sensation, loss of consciousness, impairment of psychic function, or convulsive movements. The term epilepsy is used to describe chronic, recurrent seizures. [HPO:probinson]|MEDLINEPLUS_20151021:<p>Seizures are symptoms of a brain problem. They happen because of sudden, abnormal electrical activity in the brain. When people think of seizures, they often think of convulsions in which a person's body shakes rapidly and uncontrollably. Not all seizures cause convulsions. There are many types of seizures and some have mild symptoms. Seizures fall into two main groups. Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, happen in just one part of the brain. Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal activity on both sides of the brain. </p> <p>Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and do not cause lasting harm. However, it is a medical emergency if seizures last longer than 5 minutes or if a person has many seizures and does not wake up between them. Seizures can have many causes, including medicines, high fevers, head injuries and certain diseases.

Sometimes blood pressure that is too low can also cause problems.</p> <p>Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other, such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower, you have low blood pressure. </p> <p>Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them. In other people, blood pressure drops below normal because of a medical condition or certain medicines.

It happens when your body has an overwhelming immune response to a bacterial infection. The chemicals released into the blood to fight the infection trigger widespread inflammation. This leads to blood clots and leaky blood vessels. They cause poor blood flow, which deprives your body's organs of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases, one or more organs fail. In the worst cases, blood pressure drops and the heart weakens, leading to septic shock.</p> <p>Anyone can get sepsis, but the risk is higher in</p> <ul> <li>People with weakened immune systems</li> <li>Infants and children</li> <li>The elderly</li> <li>People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, AIDS, cancer, and kidney or liver disease</li> <li>People suffering from a severe burn or physical trauma</li> </ul> <p>Common symptoms of sepsis are fever, chills, rapid breathing and heart rate, rash, confusion, and disorientation. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a blood test to see if the number of white blood cells is abnormal. They also do lab tests that check for signs of infection.</p> <p>People with sepsis are usually treated in hospital intensive care units. Doctors try to treat the infection, sustain the vital organs, and prevent a drop in blood pressure. Many patients receive oxygen and intravenous fluids.

The initial brief tonic phase is marked by trunk flexion followed by diffuse extension of the trunk and extremities. The clonic phase features rhythmic flexor contractions of the trunk and limbs, pupillary dilation, elevations of blood pressure and pulse, urinary incontinence, and tongue biting. This is followed by a profound state of depressed consciousness (post-ictal state) which gradually improves over minutes to hours. The disorder may be cryptogenic, familial, or symptomatic (caused by an identified disease process).
